# model_lensed_quasar
A very simple lens modeling script to analyze the galaxy-quasar lenses with both the position and flux of lensed images as the constraint.

# Installation
To run this code, you need the `Anaconda` environment and `lenstronomy` software.
```
Install anaconda:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

Install lenstronomy:
pip install lenstronomy==1.10.2
```

# How this code works?
For a brief introduction, you can refer to section 4.3 in `He et al 2022 in preparation`. For a more thorough introduction, we recommend you to read https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102340 by Charles R. Keeton.
